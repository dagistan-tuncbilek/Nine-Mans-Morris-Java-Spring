Terminology:
board,
mill :  three of their pieces on contiguous points in a straight line, vertically or horizontally,
pounding:  The act of removing an opponent's man is sometimes called "pounding" the opponent. 

*  a piece in an opponent's mill can only be removed if no other pieces are available. 
*  After all men have been placed, phase two begins.


Phase 1: Placing pieces
Phase 2: Moving pieces
Phase 3: "Flying"

At the beginning of the game, it is more important to place pieces in versatile locations rather than to try to form mills immediately 
and make the mistake of concentrating one's pieces in one area of the board.[11] An ideal position, 
which typically results in a win, allows a player to shuttle one piece back and forth between two mills, removing a piece every turn.
